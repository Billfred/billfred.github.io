<h1>Hi, I'm Billfred Leverette.</h1>
I'm in Columbia, South Carolina seeking remote or local opportunities to tackle interesting problems.  I've been working on a few things.  

<p>This GitHub Pages site is one of them, since it's good practice for using GitHub in general.  I'm learning the intricacies by starting this site off like it's 1998 all over again.  

<ul>
<li><a href="https://scriw.org">SCRIW</a> is the oldest off-season <I>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition off-season tournament in the Carolinas.  Depending on how you want to count things (and with a hall pass for 2020), it may be the older than the oldest in-season event too.  I have served on the event planning committee since its inception in 2011, and I am the voice of the event.<BR><BR>
<li><a href="https://pandamaniacs.org">Pandamaniacs</a> is the FRC team that I have mentored since late 2017 (and previously, from 2004-2006).  When I rejoined the team, they had only reached playoffs three out of fourteen seasons and were taking hours to get set up at events.  I've guided the team's transformation from competitive afterthought to regular contender in the state.  We haven't missed playoffs at anything below the world championship since 2019, and at our most recent event we rolled everything into our pit and were operational in about fifteen minutes.  Five of that was because we set the caster brakes before plugging in power.<BR><BR>
<li>In 2021, I set to work on a CircuitPython project to make a Serpente board <a href="https://github.com/Billfred/Serpente-iPad-HID">interface nicely with an iPad</a> as an HID device.  (I'd surely use a QT Py instead today, as it's cheaper but still retains USB-C.)  I wired the board to accept headphone jacks, allowing users to connect accessibility switches and perform most operations available on an iPad.<BR><BR>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kyNq892A6eGDJSxcopvoZ1432FftdXFJTBbWayHkD34/edit">Billfred's Guide to Small-Time Package Mailing</a> - During the early COVID lockdowns in 2020, many of my friends started producing personal protective equipment for healthcare workers and others in their communities.  And they were grossly overpaying on shipping because they didn't know the tricks you learn as a longtime seller of things on the internet.  By compiling my wisdom into one widely-shared document, I saved people hundreds of dollars they could plow back into making more items to give away.<BR><BR>
<li><a href="https://www.icloud.com/keynote/0DAUenx2fNX0HFQnmzKi0h3Jw#MCC_Talk_2021">Cult of the Minimum Competitive Concept</a> - A presentation I made demonstrating options for building simple and effective competition robots.  This was last updated for the start of the 2022 season.<BR><BR>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bAuf0eWbNhQXvZKRaNSq3hTDG3nwuw8uXn1LYV_mpAU/edit?usp=sharing">Sample <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition Scouting Workbook</a> - I developed this spreadsheet over several years to make it dirt simple to collect information on robots competing in matches every few minutes and translate it to actionable information.  By abstracting data display from data entry, we make the former better and the latter faster.  It also scrapes publicly-posted API information on request, allowing the team members collecting data to skip information that the referees are already entering. <i>(Note: All API keys are deactivated.)</i><BR><BR>
</ul>

I've pulled off some other interesting tasks too.  Ask me about the time I got an entire NFL stadium looking for one student to reunite them with their goat.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billfred-leverette/">You can reach me on LinkedIn.</a>
