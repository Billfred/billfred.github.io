<h1>Hi, I'm Billfred Leverette.</h1>
I've been working on a few things.  

<p>This GitHub Pages site is one of them, since it's good practice for using GitHub in general.  I'm learning the intricacies by starting this site off like it's 1998 all over again.  

<ul>
<li><a href="https://scriw.org">SCRIW</a> is the oldest off-season <I>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition off-season tournament in the Carolinas.  Depending on how you want to count things (and with a hall pass for 2020), it may be the older than the oldest in-season event too.  I serve as 1/4 of the event planning committee and am the voice of the event.<BR><BR>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kyNq892A6eGDJSxcopvoZ1432FftdXFJTBbWayHkD34/edit">Billfred's Guide to Small-Time Package Mailing</a> - During the early COVID lockdowns in 2020, many of my friends started producing personal protective equipment for healthcare workers and others in their communities.  And they were grossly overpaying on shipping because they didn't know the tricks you learn as a longtime seller of things on the internet.  By compiling my wisdom into one widely-shared document, I saved people hundreds of dollars they could plow back into making more items to give away.<BR><BR>
<li><a href="https://www.icloud.com/keynote/0DAUenx2fNX0HFQnmzKi0h3Jw#MCC_Talk_2021">Cult of the Minimum Competitive Concept</a> - A presentation I made demonstrating options for building simple and effective competition robots.  This was last updated for the start of the 2022 season.<BR><BR>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bAuf0eWbNhQXvZKRaNSq3hTDG3nwuw8uXn1LYV_mpAU/edit?usp=sharing">Sample <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition Scouting Workbook</a> - I developed this spreadsheet over several years to make it dirt simple to collect information on robots competing in matches every few minutes and translate it to actionable information.  By abstracting data display from data entry, we make the former better and the latter faster.  It also scrapes publicly-posted API information on request, allowing the team members collecting data to skip information that the referees are already entering. <i>(Note: All API keys are deactivated and are just left in place for reference.)</i><BR><BR>
</ul>

I've pulled off some other interesting tasks too.  Ask me about the time I got an entire NFL stadium and nearby convention center looking for one kid to reunite them with their goat.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billfred-leverette/">You can reach me on LinkedIn.</a>
